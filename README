Project in String Processing Algorithms (spring 2014)
Java implementations of algorithms for the multiple exact string matching problem.
Implemented algorithms: Aho-Corasick, Karp-Rabin, multipattern Shift-And.

- To compile, run ./compile.sh

- To execute tests, run ./test.sh

- The script ./run_example runs the program with some example parameters

- To start the program manually, run 'java Main' in ./out after running the compile script.
  Running the program with no arguments outputs a help text with instructions.
